3. **Cloudinary Account**: For image storage (optional but recommended)

## Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
cd /Users/amadi/Ai agenttt/LocalShop
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "🚀 Initial LocalShop deployment ready"

# Add your GitHub repository

## Step 3: Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, go to your project → Variables tab and add:

```bash
# Required
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=4000

# Database (Railway will auto-generate MongoDB URL)
MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING

# Cloudinary (for images)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# App URLs (Railway will provide these)
APP_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

## Step 4: Add Database

1. **In Railway Dashboard**: Click "New" → "Database" → "Add MongoDB"
2. **Copy Connection String**: Railway will generate `MONGODB_URI`
3. **Update Variables**: Add the MongoDB URI to your environment variables

## Step 5: Deploy!

1. **Deploy**: Railway will automatically deploy when you push to GitHub
2. **Domain**: Railway provides a free domain like `localshop-production.railway.app`
3. **Custom Domain**: (Optional) Add your own domain in Railway settings

## Step 6: Test Your Deployment

1. **Health Check**: Visit `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
2. **API Test**: Visit `https://your-app.railway.app/api/listings`
3. **Frontend**: Visit `https://your-app.railway.app`

## Troubleshooting

**Database Connection Issues:**
